      <description>Recently I had to upgrade PHP version on the build server based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to PHP 5.6 At that moment there was PHP 5.5 installed on the server. Everything should have been as easy and promising as described, for example, in this post. Yes, it was going well to the moment
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade Then dpkg claimed unmet dependencies&amp;#8230; You know, as usual. I decided &amp;#8212; f&amp;#8230;k it, I will remove existing php and everything related.</description>
