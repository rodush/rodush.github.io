      <description>By default Firefox has no Java plugin because of security issues.
One can install plugin by following next steps:
 Exit Firefox browser if it is running
 Make directory if it does not exist -&amp;gt; /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
 Make a symbolic link for libnpjp2.so file which resides in JRE directory, e.g.:
  sudo ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_20/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libnpjp2.so  Please note, that amd64 is an architecture of the OS you have installed, possibly it could be i386 in your case.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, I needed to use jqFileUPload plugin (actually modified version which provides Angular&amp;#8217;s directive around native jqFileUpload plugin).
In the same time, my Angular-base project was configured to be used together with RequireJS.
I spend few ours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong &amp;#8212; why I was getting errors in my browser&amp;#8217;s console.
Those errors were about something weird&amp;#8230; Something in `load-image-exif` and `load-image` files.</description>
