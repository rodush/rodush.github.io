      <description>Once upon a time, I needed to use jqFileUPload plugin (actually modified version which provides Angular&amp;#8217;s directive around native jqFileUpload plugin).
In the same time, my Angular-base project was configured to be used together with RequireJS.
I spend few ours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong &amp;#8212; why I was getting errors in my browser&amp;#8217;s console.
Those errors were about something weird&amp;#8230; Something in `load-image-exif` and `load-image` files.</description>
